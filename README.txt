About the project:

This project is a sentiment analysis classifier that is trained on airline reviews.  It is uses logistic regression without the use of machine learning libraries to classify reviews into "positive" or "negative" categories.  The training is done in the file "train.py" and the resulting weights dictionary is stored in "weights.json".  The program can be used/tested in the file "predict.py" where the user can enter any review which will be classified by the program.

Python3 as well as the Pandas, json and collections library must be installed.
